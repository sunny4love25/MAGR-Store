   npm install

## 🎓 Key Concepts to Understand

### What is Node.js?
A JavaScript runtime that lets you run this application on your computer.  
**Download:** https://nodejs.org/

### What is Supabase?
A backend platform that provides your database and authentication.  
**Sign up:** https://supabase.com (free tier available)

### What is npm?
Node Package Manager - installs all the libraries your store needs.  
**Comes with Node.js** - no separate installation needed.

### What is a Build?
Converting your source code into optimized files for deployment.  
**Command:** `npm run build`

### What are Environment Variables?
Secret keys and configuration stored in `.env.local` file.  
**Never share these publicly!**

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

### First, Check These:
1. Error message - Google it
2. [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
4. Restart terminal/computer

### Common First-Time Issues:

**"npm: command not found"**  
→ Node.js not installed. Install from https://nodejs.org/

**"Port 5173 already in use"**  
→ Something else is using that port. Close other apps or change port in `vite.config.ts`

**"Cannot find module"**  
→ Run: `npm install`

**"Database connection failed"**  
→ Check your `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials
