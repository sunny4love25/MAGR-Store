## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- A Supabase account (free tier available) - [Sign up here](https://supabase.com/)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git (optional but recommended)

### Step 1: Extract Files
1. Extract all files from this package to a folder on your computer
2. Open the folder in your code editor

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Open terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages (React, Tailwind, Supabase, etc.)

### Step 3: Set Up Supabase Database

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to finish setting up (2-3 minutes)
3. Go to Project Settings > API
4. Copy your:
   - Project URL
   - `anon/public` API key

5. In the Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
6. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-setup.sql` (provided below)
7. Click "Run" to create all database tables

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root folder
2. Add these lines (replace with your actual Supabase credentials):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Step 5: Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 6: Build for Production
When ready to deploy:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with your production-ready files.
